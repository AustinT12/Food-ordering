# Food-ordering

This project was used to practice my knowledge and understand of concepts in React. These concepts consists of: useEffect, useState, useReducer, and refs. The goal of this project was create an app that allows you to add food items to 'your cart', add the amount, and delete items from your cart. It was a simple project to test out different react hooks to see how they are used in different scenarios. 

## Thus project was built using:
* React
* CSS Modules

## Reflection
The project helped me apply react concepts into practice. Getting practice with these concepts helped further my understanding. I can recognize when a react hook is needed and where it is best to use it. I also learned a new technique of using css modules to stylize my components. I will be using and applying this newfound knowledge as I work with more react projects.
